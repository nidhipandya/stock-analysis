# VBA Challenge - Refactoring Code

## Overview of Project

Refactoring of VBA Stock Analysis Code Previously Written

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to Refactor a set of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Excel Subroutines previously written to perform analysis on a set of trading volume and price observations to see if they could be made to execute more quickly.

The initial set of data contained approximately 3,000 observations of one Dozen unique Stock Ticker Symbols upon which to perform analyses, and did not take a burdensome amount of computing time to complete using the Original version of the code. However, if the original subroutine(s) were presented with a hypothetically much larger set of data to compute, or a larger number of unique Stock Ticker Symbols to consider, the code in its Original form could have potentially taken much longer to execute.

As an exercise, the Original code was Refactored in a manner to complete all calculations and analyses by looping through the dataset only one time to completion. In this way, as the dataset gets larger, all other things being equal, compute time would grow linearly with the size of the data set, rather than exponentially in the case of the original code version utilizing multiple loop iterations.


## Results

Upon successful completion of the Refactoring, both versions of the code were tested for runtime performance for both Year 2017 and Year 2018.

The results of these tests are summarized below in

Table 1: [Seconds, rounded to 4 decimal places]

2017	2018
Original	0.7344	1.0508
Refactored	0.1250	0.1680
Even on a small dataset comprising observations for 12 unique values over approximately 3,000 rows, it can readily be seen that the Refactored code performs about 6 times faster than the Original code. On larger datasets, one can imagine that this could quickly add up to much more significant runtimes in actual use.

Since no matter how large the dataset grows, the Refactored code only runs the loop one time, the runtime will grow linearly according to the size of the dataset; however, the Original code adds an additional loop iteration for each new unique value under consideration, and thus the runtime could increase exponentially as the size of the dataset grows if more and more Stock Ticker Symbol values were taken into account.


## Summary

### Advantages of Refactoring Code

In this case, a definite advantage of Refactoring the code is the resulting increase in runtime efficiency.

### Disadvantages of Refactoring Code

A disadvantage of the Refactored code is in usage of available memory. The Original code uses only one Array to contain the Stock Ticker Symbols, while the calculated results are output once all the rows have been looped through for each iteration.

In contrast, the Refactored code uses 4 Arrays, 3 of which are used to temporarily store the calculated results until all the rows have been looped through. Then the Arrays themselves are looped through to output the results.
